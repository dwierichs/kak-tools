# KAK tools
Tools for automatic, deterministic KAK decompositions of Lie algebras.

The package can be pip-installed, for example via `pip install -e .` while in the main directory.

This repository contains code that is part of our publication on KAK decompositions for compilation.
It is structured as follows:
- `kak_tools/`: Source code files containing all tools
- `notebooks/`: Notebooks/scripts containing examples, applications and visualizations
- `tests/`: Minimal tests for the tools in `kak_tools/`
