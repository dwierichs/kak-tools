# KAK tools
Tools for automatic, deterministic KAK decompositions of Lie algebras.

This repository contains code that is part of our publication on KAK decompositions for compilation.
It is structured as follows:
- `src/`: Source code files containing all tools
- `notebooks/`: Notebooks containing examples, applications and visualizations
- `tests/`: Minimal tests for the tools in `src/`

Please include a minimalistic documentation string for all functionalities in your code.
This may be a single line that briefly states what a function is supposed to do. 
Even better if you include a gist of the inputs and outputs.
